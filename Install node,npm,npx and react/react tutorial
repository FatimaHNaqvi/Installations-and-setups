==>WAS FACING ISSUE THAT THE BROWSER WAS LOADING FINE BUT PROBLEMS WERE SHOWN IN VS COD.
SOLUTION:
ðŸ‘‰ VS Code / TypeScript is treating your .tsx files as plain .ts files, so JSX like <h1>hello</h1> is throwing errors like:

Cannot find name 'h1'

Unterminated regular expression literal

âœ… Here's How to Fix It
The issue is very likely missing React typings or an incorrect setup in your project.

ðŸ”§ Step-by-Step Fix
1. âœ… Install React + JSX TypeScript Support
Run this in your terminal:
npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom
==>This gives TypeScript awareness of JSX and React component types.

if this does not work then select the language mode to typescript jsx for the said files
